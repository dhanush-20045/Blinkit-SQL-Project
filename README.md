# Blinkit Retail Analytics - SQL Project

## Project Overview

This SQL-based retail analytics project examines Blinkit's sales data to uncover meaningful patterns and relationships in product performance, customer behavior, and store operations. The analysis transforms raw transactional data into strategic insights that inform business decisions across inventory management, marketing, and store operations.

## Project Datasets 

[Blinkit_Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EdSbZUdL9852dLdq14HgYfToQqymtBl-/view?usp=drive_link)

## The dataset contains Blinkit's product and outlet information with 12 attributes, including:

1) Product details: Item fat content, type, weight, visibility, and sales.

2) Outlet information: Establishment year, identifier, location tier, size, and type.

3) Sales metrics: Total sales figures and outlet ratings (all rated 5 in this sample).

## Key Observations:

1) Mix of regular and low-fat items across categories (Fruits, Frozen Foods, Household, etc.).

2) Outlets vary by location tier (Tier 1–3), size (Small/Medium/High), and type (Supermarket/Grocery).

3) Some missing values in Item Weight.

 ### **Use Case**  
 
Analyze sales performance, product visibility, and outlet efficiency.

## Business Case Study: Blinkit Retail Analytics

[Blinkit Analysis](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12nw9fsd8uWd46i9OaWb3axxNUSmGRFRs/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=107901475766506638269&rtpof=true&sd=true)

This project analyzes Blinkit's retail operations dataset to uncover actionable insights for business optimization. The data encompasses product attributes (fat content, type, weight), outlet characteristics (location, size, type), and sales performance metrics across multiple stores.

## Key focus areas include:

1) Identifying high-performing product categories and their characteristics

2) Analyzing the relationship between outlet attributes and sales performance

3) Evaluating how product visibility and weight impact sales

4) Comparing performance across different store tiers and locations

## Potential business applications:

1) Inventory optimization by identifying fast-moving products

2) Strategic placement of products based on visibility impact

3) Store format recommendations based on performance analysis

4) Pricing strategy adjustments for different product categories

The analysis aims to provide data-driven recommendations to enhance Blinkit's operational efficiency, sales performance, and customer satisfaction. 

## Technical Approach

### The project employs advanced SQL techniques including:

1) Data cleaning and standardization procedures

2) Complex aggregations and grouping operations

3) Pivot table transformations

4) Window functions for ranking and comparative analysis

5) Multi-dimensional performance evaluation
   
7) Analysis Focus Areas
   
### The exploration covers several critical business dimensions:

1) Product Analysis: Examination of sales distribution across product categories and attributes

2) Store Performance: Evaluation of outlet effectiveness across different locations and formats

3) Temporal Patterns: Investigation of sales trends across different time periods

4) Operational Metrics: Assessment of inventory visibility and customer satisfaction measures

## Business Applications

### The insights generated support various operational improvements:

1) Strategic product assortment planning

2) Data-driven store layout and placement decisions

3) Targeted promotional campaigns

5) Inventory optimization initiatives

6) Performance benchmarking across locations

## Technical Environment

1) Primary Database: Microsoft SQL Server

2) Development Tools: SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

3) Analysis Techniques: Advanced querying, data transformation, and visualization through result interpretation

## Implementation Notes

The project follows a structured analytical workflow from data preparation to insight generation, with all transformations and calculations performed directly in SQL for efficiency and reproducibility. The modular query design allows for easy adaptation to different time periods or business units.
